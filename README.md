# Chronos

Chronos is `python` package for fitting isochronal models to data. In the following a quick start-up guide is presented to get quick first results. Since `Chronos` is under active development the easiest solution (for me the developer) is to just download and use this repository as a `Python` module. 

A quick start guide will be provided soon.

Disclaimer: This package is still in development and should be used with care. Especially the Bayesian methods are prone to get stuck in local minima and all results should be thoroughly validated.
